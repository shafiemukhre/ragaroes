Our guidance assumes foreign\ncurrency will be an approximately 7% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, based\non current exchange rates.\u00a0\nTo provide some context on the approach we are taking towards setting our 2023 budget, we are making signi\u0000cant\nchanges across the board to operate more e\u0000ciently. We are holding some teams \u0000at in terms of headcount,\nshrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities. As a result, we expect headcount at\nthe end of 2023 will be approximately in-line with third quarter 2022 levels.\nWe have increased scrutiny on all areas of operating expenses. However, these moves follow a substantial\ninvestment cycle so they will take time to play out in terms of our overall expense trajectory. Some steps, like the\nongoing rationalization of our o\u0000ce footprint, will lead to incremental costs in the near term. This should set us up\nwell for future years, when we expect to return to higher rates of revenue growth.\nWe expect 2022 total expenses to be in the range of $85-87 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $85-88\nbillion. This includes an estimated $900 million in additional charges related to consolidating our o\u0000ce facilities\nfootprint that we expect to record in the fourth quarter of 2022. We anticipate our full-year 2023 total expenses will\nbe in the range of $96-101 billion. This includes an estimated $2 billion in charges related to consolidating our o\u0000ce\nfacilities footprint.\u00a0\nWe expect the slight majority of our 2023 expense dollar growth to be driven by operating expenses, with the\nremaining growth coming from cost of revenue. We expect the percentage growth rate of 2023 operating expenses\nto decelerate meaningfully as we curtail non-headcount related expense growth and keep 2023 headcount roughly\n\u0000at with current levels.
